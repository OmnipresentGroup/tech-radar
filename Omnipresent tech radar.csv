Styled components,Adopt,languages-and-frameworks,FALSE,"<p>We use <a href=""https://styled-components.com/"">Styled components</a> for styling our React apps. This allows us to reuse styles and write CSS in a way that is similar to writing React components themselves. </p>"
Jest,Adopt,languages-and-frameworks,FALSE,<p>As the industry standard test framework for Javascript apps we use Jest to test both our backend and frontend applications. It provides an easy way to run our tests and create mocked dependencies.</p>
Typescript,Adopt,languages-and-frameworks,FALSE,<p>The OP API and OA frontend are written entirely in Typescript. We are slowly migrating the OP FE from Javascript to Typescript in order to provide a better developer experience and help to reduce bugs in our code.</p>  <p>For new repos and code Typescript is our default language going forward</p>
Microservices,Assess,Techniques,FALSE,<p>Currently our API is a monolith app. We are already struggling with many teams commiting to the same repo and as we scale this will only increase. We will soon start splitting out microservices from our monolith API in order to start learning what this entails. </p>
Cypress,Trial,Tools,FALSE,<p>We will use Cypress for E2E testing our applications. There is some infrastructure work needed before we can fully create an E2E test suite but once that is done it will be full speed ahead with Cypress</p>
Javascript,Hold,languages-and-frameworks,FALSE,<p>We are slowly migrating the OP FE app away from Javascript in order to provide a better developer experience using Typescript.</p> <p>We will no longer be adding new Javascript to our applications</p>
ExpressJS,Adopt,languages-and-frameworks,FALSE,<p>We use express as a minimalist framework to build our REST APIs on.</p> <p>Our OP API is an express app wrapped in the serverless framework.</p>
Auth0,Adopt,Tools,FALSE,<p>Auth0 handles the authentication of our users and contains role information for each user which our application then uses to determine what a user can and can't do.</p>
Serverless.js,Adopt,languages-and-frameworks,FALSE,"<p>Serverless.js is the framework we use to provision our backend infrastructure. Our OP API app is an express app 'wrapped' in the serverless framework which, using cloud formation, creates a lambda, API gateway, Databases for our app. </p>"
Redux,Hold,languages-and-frameworks,FALSE,<p>Redux is the global state management framework we used when first building out our OP FE application. We are now moving away from Redux towards using React-query as Redux introduces a lot of boilerplate overhead and is overkill for what we were using it for.</p>
React-query,Adopt,languages-and-frameworks,FALSE,<p>React query is our go to library on the FE for handling communications with our API and managing global client side state</p><p>We are in the process of moving away from Redux and so any new features should be using React query</p>
React testing library,Adopt,languages-and-frameworks,FALSE,<p>React testing library is a framework we use to make testing our React application easier and the tests closer to how our users use the app in the wild. </p>

Mock service worker,Trial,languages-and-frameworks,FALSE,<p>Mock service worker allows us to create a stubbed service worker which we can use in tests to intercept requests and control the response our app receives when making API calls. </p>
Joi,Hold,languages-and-frameworks,FALSE,"<p>Traditionally we have used Joi to validate our the requests to the API, we are moving away from this towards using Celebrate. So any new validations on the API should be using celebrate</p><p>We are still using Joi to validate our forms on the Frontend</p>"

Design system,Trial,Techniques,FALSE,<p>In order to keep our components and styling consistent across our apps and speed up development of new features we will be looking at creating a design system which can be used across FE apps</p>
Microfrontends,Assess,Techniques,FALSE,<p>Currently our OP FE is a monolith app. We are already struggling with many teams commiting to the same repo and as we scale this will only increase. We also have different security needs for our different apps/user types and so we will start to investigate how we could move to a microfrontend approach for our frontend apps.</p>

Quality Culture Transition Guide,Assess,Techniques,FALSE,<p>A guide to help teams and departments move towards a quality culture
Four key metrics,Adopt,Techniques,FALSE,"<p>To measure software delivery performance, more and more organizations are turning to the <strong>four key metrics</strong> as defined by the <a href=""https://www.devops-research.com/"">DORA research</a> program: change lead time, deployment frequency, mean time to restore (MTTR) and change fail percentage. This research and its statistical analysis have shown a clear link between high delivery performance and these metrics; they provide a great leading indicator for how a team, or even a whole delivery organization, is doing.</p>

<p>We're still big proponents of these metrics, but we've also learned some lessons since we first started monitoring them. And we're increasingly seeing misguided measurement approaches with tools that help teams measure these metrics based purely on their continuous delivery (CD) pipelines. In particular when it comes to the stability metrics (MTTR and change fail percentage), CD pipeline data alone doesn't provide enough information to determine what a deployment failure with real user impact is. Stability metrics only make sense if they include data about real incidents that degrade service for the users.</p>

<p>And as with all metrics, we recommend to always keep in mind the ultimate intention behind a measurement and use them to reflect and learn. For example, before spending weeks to build up sophisticated dashboard tooling, consider just regularly taking the <a href=""https://www.devops-research.com/quickcheck.html"">DORA quick check</a> in team retrospectives. This gives the team the opportunity to reflect on which <a href=""https://www.devops-research.com/research.html#capabilities"">capabilities</a> they could work on to improve their metrics, which can be much more effective than overdetailed out-of-the-box tooling.</p>"
